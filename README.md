# L18-Smithing-Overhaul
## Summary
Smithing overhaul â€“ datapack that allows you to apply some of the low-level enchantments to equipment using common materials. This datapack also changes vanilla recipes a lot, even changing melting times of certain metals and productivity of different types of furnaces. A quick summary of the main changes is listed below:
1. Removed diamond equipment recipes, now this luxurious items can only be bought or found in structures;
2. Melting metals in the regular and blasting furnaces now gives much more experience, but also requires more time and coal;
3. Melting metals in the regular furnace is now not profitable, the recipes were adjusted in favor of the blasting furnace;
4. Recipes for all metallic equipment were reworked to add complexity and variety in the materials needed;
5. Added chainmail recipe;
6. Added equipment upgrade mechanic on smithing blocks (smithing table, grindstone, anvil).
7. Melting equipment in furnaces is now guaranteed to give one ingot of material instead of a nugget.

## Smelting and Blasting changes
Here is a table summarizing the new amount of resources produced by melting in various furnaces, the melting time in ticks, and the amount of experience gained.

## Equipment upgrade mechanics
Different blocks are used to work on different equipment (e.g. armor is upgraded on the anvil whereas weapons and tools are upgraded on the grindstone, while the smithing table upgrades everything slightly), and the available enchantments also vary depending on the profession block. List of all enchantments, their maximum level and the required material for each profession block are presented in the table below. To upgrade your equipment, you need to take the material you want to apply in the offhand and the tool you want to upgrade in the mainhand, then click the profession block (anvil, grindstone, smithing table) with your RMB, but be careful if you decide to experiment and reveal all the recipes without the hint table below: the wrong combination of tool, material and workstation will spend the materials, but the equipment will not be upgraded.
